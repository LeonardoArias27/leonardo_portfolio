# Leonardo_portfolio

Currently, I am part of the Chair of Hydrology at the Technical University of Munich, the leading German university (https://www.cee.ed.tum.de/hydrologie/home/). In this competent environment, I have developed research as PhD candidate (for Dr.-Ing.) in the field of remote sensing applied to environmental engineering. From this valuable point of view, I have the possibility to work in a rich ambience where I developed cutting-edge research based on the application of statistical and machine learning techniques for earth observation data. My main tasks consist in a whole set of remote sensing processing and data analysis techniques including but not limited to:

### **- Acquisition and pre-processing of different field data from stakeholders** 
> Water quality and snow coverage datasets

> Cleaning NaN, interpolation of missing data, daily-monthly time series

### **- Acquisition and pre-processing of remote sensing data such as MERIS, Landsat-5-8, Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3**
> Orthorectification, reprojection, data extraction

> Atmospheric correction algorithms (C2RCC, Sen2Cor, Py6S)

> Retrieval of remote sensing reflectance for modelling purposes
    
### **- Data analysis methodology to develop predictive models**
> Scatterplots, histogram visualization, data interpretation, feature correlation, data transformation, feature engineering
    
### **- Machine learning modelling**
> Hyperparameters calibration (GridSearch, RandomSearch, PowerSet)
> Linear regression, support vector machines, random forest, gaussian processes, artificial neural networks, extreme learning machines
> Model performance evaluation (error metrics: R2, RMSE, MAE) with Cross-Validation
    
### **- Multitemporal analysis**
> Application of machine learning models for retrieval and analysis of time-series of environmental parameters
    
### **- Academic and research skills**
> Writing and preparation of research articles (academic-level english) for publication in international peer reviewed journals. Preparation and presentation of findings and methodology to broad audiences. Supervision of junior members/students to develop research.
    
### **- Identify needs for methodology improvements and develop solutions**
> Increment of data availability by data fusion

My international experience is a precious advantage, enriched by a proactive and positive character and an innate curiosity to learn and build new experience from interactions with different people and situations. I am comfortable working with entities from different environments and heterogeneous backgrounds. I have extraordinary leadership and team building skills, and I feel that a dynamic situation is the right place where to be. In the end, my engineering and applied-data-analysis background assures a solid and reliable technical understanding. Therefore, I am looking forward to a new challenging position after my promotion, to share my skills, energy, and enthusiasm.
